# Camera app with react native

A brief explinaiton on what you'll need to run the project and how.

## Installation

Make sure you have a stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Open the terminal and redirect to the project map.

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm install expo --globally
```

```bash
  npx expo start
```

Ideally, you should have been given a QR-code. Install the expo app from your respective app store on your phone. From there click scan QR-code. Your phone will automatically connect to the test server, and you can use the app and see live changes. You might find difficulties depending on the internet connection
